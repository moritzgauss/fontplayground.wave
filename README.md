# Font Logo Generator

This project is a custom logo generator that creates unique, randomly generated logos based on letterforms using harmonious line styles, geometric shapes, and hatching patterns. The generator builds the letters 'M' and 'G' (or 'mg') on an HTML5 canvas, offering a wide range of variations with each click of the "Generate New Logo" button.

## Features

- Creates typographic designs with randomized line thickness, spacing, and geometric elements like circles, lines, and boxes
- Includes optional hatching or shading for added texture
- Uses harmonious black-and-white design with common web fonts like Georgia, ensuring cross-browser compatibility
- Responsive display, adapting to various screen sizes
- Total variations calculated based on line style, spacing, shape, and font combinations

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
2. Click the "Generate New Logo" button to create a new random logo design.
3. The current variation number and total possible variations are displayed below the button.
